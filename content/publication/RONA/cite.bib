               traditionally generate diverse image captions by employing
               syntactic and semantic variations to describe image components.
               However, human-written captions prioritize conveying a central
               message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues. To
               enhance pragmatic diversity, it is essential to explore
               alternative ways of communicating these messages in conjunction
               with visual content. To address this challenge, we propose RONA,
               a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models
               (MLLM) that leverages Coherence Relations as an axis for
               variation. We demonstrate that RONA generates captions with
               better overall diversity and ground-truth alignment, compared to
               MLLM baselines across multiple domains. Our code is available at:
