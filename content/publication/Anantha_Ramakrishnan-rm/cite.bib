  abstract      = "Text-to-Image (T2I) Synthesis has made tremendous strides in
                   enhancing synthesized image quality, but current datasets
                   evaluate model performance only on descriptive,
                   instruction-based prompts. Real-world news image captions
                   take a more pragmatic approach, providing high-level
                   situational and Named-Entity (NE) information and limited
                   physical object descriptions, making them abstractive. To
                   evaluate the ability of T2I models to capture intended
                   subjects from news captions, we introduce the Abstractive
                   News Captions with High-level cOntext Representation (ANCHOR)
                   dataset, containing 70K+ samples sourced from 5 different
                   news media organizations. With Large Language Models (LLM)
                   achieving success in language and commonsense reasoning
                   tasks, we explore the ability of different LLMs to identify
                   and understand key subjects from abstractive captions. Our
                   proposed method Subject-Aware Finetuning (SAFE), selects and
                   enhances the representation of key subjects in synthesized
                   images by leveraging LLM-generated subject weights. It also
                   adapts to the domain distribution of news images and captions
                   through custom Domain Fine-tuning, outperforming current T2I
                   baselines on ANCHOR. By launching the ANCHOR dataset, we hope
                   to motivate research in furthering the Natural Language
                   Understanding (NLU) capabilities of T2I models.",
