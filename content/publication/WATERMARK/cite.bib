  abstract      = "With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs),
                   safeguarding textual content against unauthorized use is
                   crucial. Text watermarking offers a vital solution,
                   protecting both - LLM-generated and plain text sources. This
                   paper presents a unified overview of different perspectives
                   behind designing watermarking techniques, through a
                   comprehensive survey of the research literature. Our work has
                   two key advantages, (1) we analyze research based on the
                   specific intentions behind different watermarking techniques,
                   evaluation datasets used, watermarking addition, and removal
                   methods to construct a cohesive taxonomy. (2) We highlight
                   the gaps and open challenges in text watermarking to promote
                   research in protecting text authorship. This extensive
                   coverage and detailed analysis sets our work apart, offering
                   valuable insights into the evolving landscape of text
                   watermarking in language models.",
