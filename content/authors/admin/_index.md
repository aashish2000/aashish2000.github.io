Hello! I'm a third-year PhD Candidate at the [Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu), co-advised by [Prof. Dongwon Lee](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/) and [Prof. Sharon Huang](http://faculty.ist.psu.edu/suh972/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Vision & Language, with a focus on multi-modal generative models and 3D Computer Vision. Prior to my PhD, I received my B.E in Computer Science and Engineering from [SSN College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in), Chennai, India.

As a member of the [PIKE Research Group](https://pike.psu.edu), I work on enhancing contextual alignment of Vision & Language Models in neural news media generation problems. Currently, my research is aimed at improving sentence understanding of Text-to-Image generators when prompted with **Abstractive News Captions**. Recognizing the security risks these domain-specific Language Models pose such as fake news synthesis and copyright infringement, I am also keen on exploring robust text watermarking strategies for downstream generation tasks.



<!-- I'm also keen on exploring the security implications of domain-specific generative models such as copyright protection. Particularly, I am interested in embedding-level text watermarking strategies that are robust to adversarial attacks with minimal impact to generation quality.  -->

In the past, I have had the opportunity to do internships at **The Washington Post**, **Ford Motor Company**,  and other Computer Vision startups. I'm always *open to collaboration* and research discussions on topics related to Vision & Language tasks. Feel free to drop me an email or ping me on LinkedIn if you wish to get in touch with me! 

<!-- Some of my internship projects such as Factuality Evaluation of LLMs on QA tasks, Head Tracking-based Ticketing Solutions for Public Transit, AR-enabled interactive learning tools, etc.  -->
